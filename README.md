# Advent of Code 2020
My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) challenges.

They are all written in Kotlin and can be run as is on the [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/). I had to convert some input files to strings to make this work. Perhaps that is cheating.

The solutions are not optimized for time, length, or anything else. This is because I am both lazy and not particularly clever.
